# Deploying-Web-Application-in-AWS-Cloud.

If you plan to deploy your application in AWS cloud, below are some reference points:

Plan your architecture: Begin by planning your architecture and deciding on the different components of your multi-tier web application, such as a front-end load balancer, web server, application server, and database.

Set up your VPC: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate your web application and configure subnets for each tier.

Launch EC2 instances: Launch EC2 instances for each tier of your web application, and ensure they are properly configured with security groups and IAM roles.

Configure your load balancer: Set up your load balancer, such as Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), to distribute traffic across your web servers and ensure high availability.

Set up your database: Launch and configure your database, such as Relational Database Service (RDS), and ensure it is properly secured and optimized for your web application.

Configure your DNS: Set up your DNS records to route traffic to your load balancer.

Test and optimize: Once your web application is deployed, test it thoroughly to ensure it is working as expected, and optimize it for performance and scalability.

Implement security best practices: Implement best practices for securing your web application, such as using SSL certificates, network security groups, and IAM roles.
